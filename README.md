# Stepping-in-Space

This website marks for me the graduation from beign a beginner to an intermediate Full-Stack Web Developer. The road wasn't easy and though it wasn't all fun the time, I enjoyed it. I learnt about the **MVC pattern, SOLID PHP, Laravel, CSS flex-box, CSS grid, nginx, git, a lot of Sublime Text plugins and many others seen below.** I did many mistakes as well. For example I first had to first plan what and how I was going to do. I mean, things like a **TO DO list and mockups** would come handy to not be testing different ways to do things in development. Another of my mistakes was to commit every small change I make to the project. It was mostly a compulsive instinct to save every small change. I also must mention that there are some small quickfixes in the HTML & CSS (Hard to tell ðŸ™ˆ). With this I can tell that working with the frontend isn't one of my strong skills.

Finally, though I learnt a lot from this project I don't meant to pretend to be an expert in the subject, but now I know of this topics and surely I can follow along other's people code and conversations when I see them.
